# Cancer Death Rate Data Visualization Dashboard

# Overview
This project aims to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes cancer death rate data. The dashboard is designed to help users understand and analyze trends in cancer mortality, identify patterns across different demographics and regions, and provide valuable insights for cancer researchers.

Target User and Use Case: 

A cancer epidemiologist working at an international health organization. Her research focuses on global cancer trends, with a particular interest in comparing cancer mortality rates across different EU countries to inform international public health strategies.

# Features
Interactive Visualizations: Users can explore various charts and graphs that display cancer death rates by EU countries.

Filter and Search Options: Allows users to filter data based on specific criteria, making it easier to find relevant information.

Comparative Analysis: Visualizes trends over time, helping to identify increases or decreases in cancer death rates.

Custom Data Upload: Users can generate and download custom reports based on their selected data and visualizations.

# Data Sources
The dashboard utilizes publicly available cancer death rate data from : https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type

# Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, D3.js for interactive data visualizations
Backend: Node.js

# Instructions on how to run the application

1. Go to "code" on https://github.com/olorunfemi-oluwasegun/Innovation-and-Complexity-Management
2. Under code open codespaces
3. Then "create a codespace on main" to setup the codespaces
4. Wait for some time for the application to build, upon completion, you will see a "dist" folder
5. then run "npm run dev"
6. Then you will open the app in the browser
